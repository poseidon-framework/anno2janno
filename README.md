# poseidon2

Validation, merging, subsetting and conversion of Poseidon v.2 packages both in R and on the command line.

## Command line interface

```
poseidon2 --help
```

Show a manual page.

```
poseidon2 --version
```

Show the poseidon2 package version.

```
poseidon2 convert <output_format> <input_package> <output_directory> [--log_directory=DIR]
```

Convert the genetic data in a Poseidon v.2 package to another format.

- **output_format**: Output format of the conversion. Available options: `eigenstrat` (uses convertf)
- **input_package**: Path to the input package directory
- **output_directory**: Path to the output directory
- **log_directory**: Path to the directory for log files and temporary data

```
poseidon2 extract <filter_file> <input_package> <output_directory> [--log_directory=DIR]
```

Extract individuals from a Poseidon v.2 package and create a new subset package (uses plink1.9).

- **filter_file**: Text file with the individuals that should be kept. [A space/tab-delimited text file with family IDs in the first column and within-family IDs in the second column](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#indiv)
- **input_package**: Path to the input package directory
- **output_directory**: Path to the output directory
- **log_directory**: Path to the directory for log files and temporary data

```
poseidon2 merge <input_file> <output_directory> [--log_directory=DIR]
```

Combine multiple Poseidon v.2 packages and create a new merged package (uses plink1.9).

- **input_file**: Text file with the paths to the packages that should be merged. A text file with each package path in one row. Empty rows and rows starting with `#` are ignored
- **output_directory**: Path to the output directory
- **log_directory**: Path to the directory for log files and temporary data

```
poseidon2 validate <input_janno_file_or_packages>...
```

Validate Poseidon v.2 packages or individual .janno files.

- **input_janno_file_or_packages**: One or multiple paths to package directories or .janno files

`validate` always tries to give you comprehensive and specific information about what seems to be wrong with a package or .janno file. Some times though it can not test lower level aspects as long as top level issues are not fixed. That means new errors might pop up after fixing top level problems. If you're preparing a package you should rerun the validator until it does not show any remaining issues. It's also likely that the validator does not catch every possible mistake one could introduce when preparing a package. It's supposed to be helpful, but can never be perfect.

## R interface 

Above described command line modules can also be called from within R. 

Beyond that poseidon2 provides a dedicated R S3 class `janno` that inherits from `tibble` and allows to tidily read .janno files into R. This allows to work systematically with the individual-wise context information in a Poseidon v.2 package -- for example with the tools of the tidyverse.

There are also dedicated class methods that can be applied to .janno objects.

```
poseidon2::process.age()
```

Process age information stored in .janno files. E.g. apply sum calibration on radiocarbon dates to get proper median ages and to draw samples from the post-calibration probability distribution.

```
...
```

## Installation

**For MPI-SHH members: The poseidon2 command line utility is already installed on the MPI-SHH-DAG cluster. You do not have to install the software.**

Install the poseidon2 R package from github with the following command in R. That allows you to use all its functions within R.

```
if(!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('poseidon-framework/poseidon2')
```

If you want to use the CLI interface you can copy it to your user directory with `poseidon2::quick_install()`, make it exectutable (`chmod +x poseidon2.R`) and run it with `./poseidon2.R --help`. 

Multiple package functions require [plink1.9](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) and the [eigensoft](https://github.com/DReichLab/EIG) software package to be installed on your computer.

Another way to install and use the poseidon2 command line utility is available via [singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/). For that you have to install singularity on your computer, clone the poseidon2 repository, navigate to the `singularity` directory and run `sudo singularity build poseidon2.sif poseidon2.def`. You can then use the tool with `singularity exec poseidon2.sif /poseidon2.R --help`. plink1.9 and convertf are already installed in the singularity container and do not have to be installed separately with this solution.

## For developers

The script can be found in the `inst/` directory. A normal development workflow would be to modify the package, build it (!), and then run the script in `inst/`. Cluster deployment currently works via singularity (see `singularity`).

When pushing to this repository this [pre-commit hook shared by Robert M Flight](https://rmflight.github.io/post/package-version-increment-pre-and-post-commit-hooks) should be used to increment the R package version number in the DESCRIPTION on every commit automatically. Use `doIncrement=FALSE git commit -m "commit message"` to avoid this behaviour for individual commits.
