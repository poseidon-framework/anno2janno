# poseidon2

A CLI tool for merging, convertion and validation of poseidon2 packages.

## Quickstart

1. Install poseidon2 R package from github within R 

```
if(!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('sidora-tools/sidora.cli')
```

2. Install the script in your user directory with `poseidon2::quick_install()` within R
3. Make the main script file executable with `chmod +x poseidon2.R`
4. Run it with `./poseidon2.R --help`

## For developers

The script can be found in the `inst/` directory. A normal development workflow would be to modify the package, build it (!), and then run the script in `inst/`. Cluster deployment currently works via singularity (see `singularity/`).
