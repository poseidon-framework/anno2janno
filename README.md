# poseidon2

Validation, merging, subsetting and convertion of Poseidon v.2 packages both in R and on the command line.

## Command line interface

```
poseidon2 --help
```

Show a manual page.

```
poseidon2 --version
```

Show the poseidon2 package version.

```
poseidon2 convert <output_format> <input_package> <output_directory> [--log_directory=DIR]
```

Convert the genetic data in a Poseidon v.2 package to another format.

- **output_format**: Output format of the conversion. Available options: `eigenstrat` (uses convertf)
- **input_package**: Path to the input package directory
- **output_directory**: Path to the output directory
- **log_directory**: Path to the directory for log files and temporary data

```
poseidon2 extract <filter_file> <input_package> <output_directory> [--log_directory=DIR]
```

Extract individuals from a Poseidon v.2 package and create a new subset package (uses plink1.9).

- **filter_file**: Text file with the individuals that should be kept. [A space/tab-delimited text file with family IDs in the first column and within-family IDs in the second column](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/1.9/filter#indiv)
- **input_package**: Path to the input package directory
- **output_directory**: Path to the output directory
- **log_directory**: Path to the directory for log files and temporary data

```
poseidon2 merge <input_file> <output_directory> [--log_directory=DIR]
```

Combine multiple Poseidon v.2 packages and create a new merged package (uses plink1.9).

- **input_file**: Text file with the paths to the packages that should be merged. A text file with each package path in one row. Empty rows and rows starting with `#` are ignored
- **output_directory**: Path to the output directory
- **log_directory**: Path to the directory for log files and temporary data

```
poseidon2 validate <input_janno_file_or_packages>...
```

Validate Poseidon v.2 packages or individual .janno files.

- **input_janno_file_or_packages**: One or multiple paths to package directories or .janno files

## R interface

## Installation

**For MPI-SHH members: The poseidon2 command line utility is already installed on the MPI-SHH-DAG cluster. You do not have to install the software.**

Install the poseidon2 R package from github with the following command in R. That allows you to use all its functions within R.

```
if(!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('poseidon-framework/poseidon2')
```

If you want to use the CLI interface you can copy it to your user directory with `poseidon2::quick_install()`, make it exectutable (`chmod +x poseidon2.R`) and run it with `./poseidon2.R --help`. 

Multiple package functions require [plink1.9](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) and the [eigensoft](https://github.com/DReichLab/EIG) software package to be installed on your computer.

Another way to install and use the poseidon2 command line utility is available via [singularity](https://sylabs.io/docs/). For that you have to install singularity on your computer, clone the poseidon2 repository, navigate to the `singularity` directory and run `sudo singularity build poseidon2.sif poseidon2.def`. You can then use the tool with `singularity exec poseidon2.sif /poseidon2.R --help`. plink1.9 and convertf are already installed in the singularity container and do not have to be installed separately with this solution.

## For developers

The script can be found in the `inst/` directory. A normal development workflow would be to modify the package, build it (!), and then run the script in `inst/`. Cluster deployment currently works via singularity (see `singularity`).

When pushing to this repository this [pre-commit hook shared by Robert M Flight](https://rmflight.github.io/post/package-version-increment-pre-and-post-commit-hooks) should be used to increment the R package version number in the DESCRIPTION on every commit automatically. Use `doIncrement=FALSE git commit -m "commit message"` to avoid this behaviour for individual commits.
