# poseidon2

poseidon2 provides a dedicated R S3 class `janno` that inherits from `tibble` and allows to tidily read and manipulate `.janno` files.

## Installation

Install the poseidon2 package from github with the following command in R:

```
if(!require('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github('poseidon-framework/poseidon2')
```

## Quickstart

### Read janno files

```
my_janno <- read_janno("path/to/my/janno_file.janno")
```

`read_janno` also takes directories and searches recursively for `.janno` files.

### Dating information processing

```
process_age(
  my_janno,
  choices = c("Date_BC_AD_Prob", "Date_BC_AD_Median_Derived", "Date_BC_AD_Sample"),
  n = 100
)
```

Process age information stored in .janno files. E.g. apply sum calibration on radiocarbon dates to get proper median ages and to draw samples from the post-calibration probability distribution.

## For developers

- When pushing to this repository this [pre-commit hook shared by Robert M Flight](https://rmflight.github.io/post/package-version-increment-pre-and-post-commit-hooks) should be used to increment the R package version number in the DESCRIPTION on every commit automatically. Use `doIncrement=FALSE git commit -m "commit message"` to avoid this behaviour for individual commits.
- `tests/testthat/poseidonTestData` is a [git submodule](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/). It mirrors a certain stage of [poseidon-framework/poseidonTestData](https://github.com/poseidon-framework/poseidonTestData) but has to be updated manually.
